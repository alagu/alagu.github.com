Hi there, I’m Alagu.

I’m an Engineer, Product guy – mostly a maker. I love building useful things. I’ve worked previously at Yahoo!, Zynga, Hackerrank and Practo. I also built my own startup – Markupwand, part of YCombinator Summer 2012.

Currently, I’m building [Peoplebox](https://www.peoplebox.ai) – an People Management tool for remote teams.

My interests are Products, Longevity, Yoga and Tamil Music.
