I started reading this book to understand in an unbiased way about the Srilankan civil war. My notes from this book:

I felt Samanth wasn't so unbiased. He is neither pro-LTTE nor pro-Sinhalese, but he was definitely pro-Tamil. Samanth has tried to be as much neutral as possible, but there were several pieces of the story which was revealing as well as raising questions for me.

Being grown up with the thought process of "Non-violence" taught in our school books by the then congress government in India, I was mostly under the influence that armed struggle is generally bad. It won't end up in a positive impact. A political solution is always better. I felt while reading [Lady and the Peacock](https://www.amazon.in/Lady-Peacock-Life-Aung-Burma/dp/184604250X/). It felt that Armed struggle got independence for Burma while Suu Kyi was leading the political movement. The question that still I don't have answer - was Armed struggle the only way that Ealam tamils felt the way out? There have been several Militant groups. Some 3 funded directly by Indira Gandhi government then. If they had taken a political route, would they have succeeded? They did try to have a press-conference (first and last one). Also, why was demand for a separate country a non-negotiable? Was there some way in middle?

The one that shook me the most was the story around how the Tigers [expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Muslims_from_the_Northern_province_by_LTTE) muslims from the Northern province by force. If someone who would have felt the pressure of being minority, it should be have been tigers. When Muslims being minority within the tamil population are expelled - it is hypocracy at its peak. 

I did feel that the LTTE assasinating  Rajiv Gandhi was downright most stupid thing that they could ever do. They were horrible at political strategy. Suicide bombing, child soldiers were somethign I knew of and had disagreements on. 

Inspite of the serious issues by Prabhakaran, I felt he was the only identity for Ealam Tamils, sort of least-worst option. But after reading this book, my respect fell down by a notch. His intentions weren't all so pure either. The supremo didn't really know how to negotiate. Rather he didn't want to. He was hell-bent on his personal ego fight.  What shocked me most is how many lives were lost from his own groups, his own leaders who were killed because they didn't agree with his philosophies. There was mistrust throughout the organization. I do question Tamil leaders who blindly take his support. 

Innocent victims were the ones who didn't side with anyone. The influence of Indian Peace Keeping Force (the name itself is ironic) has to be awarded one of the worst ever interventions. Moving from dropping food packets to directly attacking them to doing so many war-crimes, I definitely expected better of Indian Army. The way the Army (Lions) and Tigers fought maniacally to "must-end" mode of war was brutal. Stories of 10-day old babies dying because of shells is just hard to digest.

Reading through the book felt like I was travelling through Northern Srilanka (Jaffna, Kilinochi, Vanni, etc). The cities are beautiful and so is their Tamil. The country by itself is beautiful. Post war, I could see that there has been significant investment in the country. They have rebuilt a lot also erased and changed history as much as they could. 

People have been left with scars. Even after 75 years of partition, the scars remain in Punjab and Bengal. There will be untold stories. These scars will remain - abandoned houses, missing people, conflicted families. Only way to resolve them is to let them flourish - in their own way.
