First strategy book in a long time. Have been generally adviced not to read so many strategy books, but this was very interesting one.  I started reading this to get better at negotiation — not just in work scenarios but also negotiate with daughter. Lot of this book seemed to be rooted in psychology and therapy than rather than logic or compromise.

The author is a former FBI hostage negotiator - so definitely there is high credibility.  Breaks down high-stakes negotiation to simple actions. 


Take aways:

1. Similar to therapy: Listen to the other person and empathize with them. You can just hear and it reduces the heat.
2. Just repeat the last 2–3 words they said — and let silence do the work. It’s awkward at first but weirdly effective in getting people to open up. This worked brilliantly well in one of the wierd situations where the airline guy refused to let my dad board because of visa issues, but in the end he not only let us board but also helped them with immigration.
3. Let the other person say no. A lot of times, saying “no” actually means _“Tell me more.”_ Let people say no instead of pushing them into yes.
4. The author kept saying calibrated questions, though I didn't understand much, but I assume they said - open-ended questions like _“How am I supposed to do that?”_ . This is interesting, but haven't worked yet with me. 
5. Self-accusation: Call out every possible negative the other person may think about you before they do. This is quite self-deprecating, but works.
6. Use the calm, late-night FM DJ voice. It instantly reduces tension. _(agree on this)_
7. People have a deep emotional attachment to the idea of fairness. Saying _“I want you to feel this is fair”_ can change the energy in a conversation.
8. Use time limits, loss aversion, and the illusion of control to anchor the conversation. Never rush. Deadlines are rarely real.
9. There was example of a guy who want to be shot by police. Lot of times it is unknown what the other personw ants. “Black Swans”. Stay curious to uncover them.
10. Prepare a negotiation sheet before you go the negotiation table. (agree with this)
11. Always prefer face to face. Body language, tone is lot more valuable.

What was most impressive is that he mentioned Oprah Winfrey is the best negotiator. She makes people to talk about deep private stuff in public television
