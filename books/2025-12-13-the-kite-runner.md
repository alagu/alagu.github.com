This book was an emotional roller coaster. It was an easy read and a definite page turner. This is the second war related book I have read, but this one is fiction tied closely to real historical events.

So much history is woven into the story that at times I suspected it might be Khaled Hosseini’s own story. It feels like many parts come from his personal experiences in Kabul. He is a phenomenal storyteller, and through this book I understood much more about Afghans and Afghanistan.

I read the beginning slowly, over several days. But the last 200 pages I read non stop and finished in just two days. The feelings of regret and guilt in the story are deeply relatable.

The ending felt very real. Sohrab does not suddenly fit into the family, even though we hope for a happy ever after. Life rarely works that way. We carry a lot of baggage as we grow up, and sometimes that baggage and those expectations become our identity.

When the story starts in Kabul, with an entitled child, a rich father, and a missing mother, it feels uncomfortable but distant. But the story of the Hazaras and the ethnic discrimination they face feels very real and painful, similar to the idea of a divided land. It has less facts and more fiction, which makes it easier to connect emotionally. The move from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and later to the US, was eye opening. I have met many Afghan cab drivers in the Bay Area, but I never knew there was such a strong Afghan community there.

The part where he meets Soraya, asks his father to speak to her family, and assumes she likes him felt very human. His guilt over Hassan stays with him for years, and that guilt finally drives him back to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Afghanistan as a country has suffered so much, and reading this made me feel grateful to live in a place with at least some stability. Going back, facing his childhood enemy, rescuing his nephew, and adopting him was another emotional high and low. Sohrab’s suicide attempt was especially painful. PTSD is real, and the book does not shy away from that.

Some parts of the story were hard to read. At times I wondered why I put myself through such pain. Maybe these stories remind me that whatever problems we think we have, they are often small compared to what others endure.

This is only the second book I have read this year, and I hope to read many more.
