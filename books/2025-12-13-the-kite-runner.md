This book was an emotional roller coaster. This is second fiction with historical events tied together. Almost so much of history closely connected that I had so much of suspicision that this was Khaled's original story. But seems like many parts of the story were from his personal experiences in Kabul. Khaled is a phenomenal story teller.  I udnerstood more about Afghans and Afghanistan.

I read the initial part of the story very slow, read it over several days, but the last 200 pages, I read voraciously. Finished in two days. The regret and guilt is so much relatable. 

He set it so relatable that in the end Sohrab still didn't completely get along with the family, we wanted a happy-lived-ever-after story.  But there is very rarely things like that. There is so much of baggage you carry as you grow up. Sometimes the baggage, the expectations become your identity. 

When the story started with Kabul where there is a entitled kid with his rich dad without his mother longing for father's affection - it still felt entitled. But the story of Hazaras going through ethnic discrimiation felt so relatable, similar to the story of Divided Island. But less fact, more fiction. Then the moving from Afghanistan to Pakistan. I've met several Afghan cab drivers in Bay Area, never knew there was a thriving afghan community in US. Then the entire story about how he meets Soraya, makes his father go and ask for her. Though may be he assumed Soraya likes him in an obvious way. The way he still lives with guilt with Haasan for so long and finally goes to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Afghanistan as a country has suffered so much - I feel we are gifted to be in a country where there is some stability. Finally going back to Afghanistan, meeting his childhood nemesis and getting his nephew back, adopting him. It was also another roller coaster that Sohrab tried suicide to be away from everything. PTSD is real. 

Sometimes these stories are too painful to read. I don't know what this gives me. It probably says whatever we are going through is nothing.  

While this year, this is is just the second book - I hope to read more.
