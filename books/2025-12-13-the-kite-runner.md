This book was a super roller coaster. This is second fiction with historical events tied together. Almost so much of history closely connected that I had so much of suspicision that this was Khaled's original story. But seems like many parts of the story were from his personal experiences in Kabul. Khaled is a phenomenal story teller. 

I read the initial part of the story very slow, read it over several days, but the last 200 pages, I read voraciously. Finished in two days. The regret and guilt is so much relatable. 

He set it so relatable that in the end Sohrab still didn't completely get along with the family, we wanted a happy-lived-ever-after story.  But there is very rarely things like that. There is so much of baggage you carry as you grow up. Sometimes the baggage, the expectations become your identity. 

While this year, this is is just the second book - I hope to read more.
